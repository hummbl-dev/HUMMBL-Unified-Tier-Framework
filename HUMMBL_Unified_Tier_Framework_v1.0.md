## 1. Problem Complexity Tiers

### 1.1 Overview

The Problem Complexity Tier system classifies challenges based on their inherent characteristics, ranging from simple problems with clear solutions to super-wicked problems with fundamental structural barriers to resolution. This classification enables appropriate resource allocation, methodology selection, and realistic expectation setting.

**Tier Classification Basis:**
- Stakeholder agreement on problem definition and acceptable solutions
- Completeness and stability of available information
- Finality of solutions (can problems be "solved" or only managed?)
- Learning dynamics during problem-solving
- Time pressure and irreversibility of consequences

**Quantitative Scoring:**
Each problem is assessed using a 5-question rubric (0-30 points total), with tier assignments based on total score. → See [Wickedness Scoring Methodology](#4-wickedness-scoring-methodology) (Section 4) for complete assessment protocol.

---

### 1.2 Tier 1: Simple Problems (0-9 points)

---

### 1.6 Tier 5: Super-Wicked Problems (25-30 points)

**Definition:**
A subset of wicked problems with additional structural barriers: time is running out, no central authority exists, those seeking solutions are also causing the problem, and policies discount the future. The concept of super-wicked problems was introduced by Levin et al. (2012) in the context of global climate change.

**HUMMBL's Contribution:**
While the concept originates in academic literature, HUMMBL has developed a formalized operationalization including quantitative criteria, assessment protocols, and integration with the Base-N architecture.

**Characteristics:**

- **Information:** Incomplete with irreducible uncertainty about future states
- **Solution Finality:** No solutions; only interventions that shift trajectories
- **Learning Curve:** Extreme; understanding requires multi-generational perspective
- **Time Dynamics:** Critical urgency with irreversible tipping points

**Defining Criteria (HUMMBL Operationalization):**
1. **Time is running out:** Irreversible consequences approaching
2. **No central authority:** No single entity can impose solutions
3. **Causers are solvers:** Those seeking solutions contribute to the problem
4. **Future discounting:** Policies favor present benefits over future costs

**Examples:**
- Global climate change
- Antimicrobial resistance
- Nuclear proliferation
- AI alignment and safety
- Ocean acidification

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base42 (expert/master level) or BASE120 (research/mastery)

**Typical Approach:**
- Accept fundamental uncertainty and irreversibility
- Build coalitions across traditional boundaries
- Design for long-term institutional commitment
- Create mechanisms to constrain present behavior for future benefit
- Integrate multiple frameworks and perspectives simultaneously
- Focus on trajectory shifts rather than endpoint solutions

## 4. Wickedness Scoring Methodology

### 4.1 5-Question Assessment

The HUMMBL Wickedness Scoring Methodology provides a quantitative framework for classifying problem complexity. Each problem is assessed across 5 dimensions, with scores ranging from 0-6 points per question (total: 0-30 points).

#### Question 1: Stakeholder Agreement (0-6 points)

**What it measures:** The degree of consensus among stakeholders about problem definition and acceptable solutions.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **0 points:** Universal agreement on both problem and solution
- **1-2 points:** High agreement; minor negotiation needed
- **3-4 points:** Moderate disagreement; significant stakeholder management required
- **5-6 points:** Fundamental disagreement on problem definition itself

**Assessment Questions:**
- Do stakeholders agree on what the problem is?
- Do stakeholders agree on what constitutes an acceptable solution?
- Are there conflicting values or interests at play?
- Can stakeholders be brought to consensus through dialogue?

---

#### Question 2: Information Completeness (0-6 points)

**What it measures:** The availability, stability, and reliability of information needed to understand and address the problem.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **0 points:** Complete, stable information; all variables known
- **1-2 points:** Mostly complete; minor gaps fillable through analysis
- **3-4 points:** Incomplete and changing; new information emerges during solving
- **5-6 points:** Fundamentally incomplete; irreducible uncertainty about key factors

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is all necessary information available?
- Is the information stable or constantly changing?
- Can information gaps be filled through research?
- Are there unknowable aspects of the problem?

---

#### Question 3: Solution Finality (0-6 points)

#### Question 5: Time Pressure & Irreversibility (0-6 points)

**What it measures:** The urgency of action and the reversibility of consequences.

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **0 points:** No time pressure; fully reversible if errors occur
- **1-2 points:** Some urgency; mostly reversible with effort
- **3-4 points:** Moderate urgency; some irreversible consequences
- **5-6 points:** Critical urgency; irreversible tipping points and time running out

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is there a deadline or time constraint?
- Can actions be undone if they don't work?
- Are there irreversible consequences?
- Is time running out to address the problem?

---

### 4.2 Tier Classification Formula

**Total Score Calculation:**
Sum scores from all 5 questions (range: 0-30 points)

**Tier Assignment:**
- **Tier 1 (Simple):** 0-9 points
- **Tier 2 (Complicated):** 10-14 points
- **Tier 3 (Complex):** 15-19 points
- **Tier 4 (Wicked):** 20-24 points
- **Tier 5 (Super-Wicked):** 25-30 points

**Interpretation Guidelines:**
- Scores near tier boundaries may indicate transitional problems
- Consider context and domain-specific factors
- Use tier classification as guidance, not rigid prescription
- When in doubt, assess conservatively (lower tier)

---

### 4.3 Worked Examples

**Q1 - Stakeholder Agreement:** 0 points
- Universal agreement: tire is flat, needs repair/replacement
- Clear solution: patch or replace tire

**Q2 - Information Completeness:** 0 points
- All information available: tire condition, tools needed, procedure
- Stable and complete

**Q3 - Solution Finality:** 0 points
- Problem can be completely solved
- Clear "done" state when tire is functional

**Q4 - Learning During Solving:** 0 points
- Problem fully understood before action
- Standard procedure applies

**Q5 - Time Pressure & Irreversibility:** 1 point
- Minor urgency (need to get somewhere)
- Fully reversible if wrong approach taken

**Total Score:** 1 point → **Tier 1 (Simple)**

---

#### Example 2: Organizational Restructuring for Scale (Tier 3 - Complex)

**Q1 - Stakeholder Agreement:** 4 points
- Significant disagreement on optimal structure
- Different departments have conflicting priorities
- Some consensus possible through negotiation

**Q2 - Information Completeness:** 4 points

- Can course-correct but with effort

**Total Score:** 17 points → **Tier 3 (Complex)**

---

#### Example 3: Global Climate Change (Tier 5 - Super-Wicked)

**Q1 - Stakeholder Agreement:** 6 points
- Fundamental disagreement on problem severity and causes
- Conflicting national and economic interests
- Values-based conflicts (growth vs. sustainability)

**Q2 - Information Completeness:** 6 points
- Irreducible uncertainty about tipping points and feedback loops
- Information constantly evolving
- Key variables unknowable (future technology, political will)

**Q3 - Solution Finality:** 6 points

## 5. Validation Evidence

### 5.1 Completed Validation Work

#### BASE120 Mental Model Validation (October 31, 2025)

**Project:** HUMMBL BASE120 Mental Model Validation Framework  
**GitLab Reference:** [https://gitlab.com/hummbl-dev-group/hummbl-dev-project](https://gitlab.com/hummbl-dev-group/hummbl-dev-project)  
**Artifact IDs:** base120-20251031-1344 (release), BASE120_summary.csv, BASE120_summary.md  
**Scope:** Complete validation of all 120 mental models across 6 transformations  
**Quality Achievement:** 9.1/10 average (ChatGPT validation: 9.2/10)  
**Status:** ✅ Release-ready, ongoing validation

**Methodology:**
- Individual validation of each mental model via GitLab issues
- Evidence blocks with applied examples from hummbl-validator project
- Quantitative metrics per model (automated scoring via metrics_check.py)
- Academic citations for theoretical grounding where applicable
- Relationship mapping across transformations (Prerequisites/Complements/Enables/Inverse)
- Automated quality checks via helper tools (citations_linter.py)
- Nightly CI (Continuous Integration) validation with drift detection

**Deliverables:**
- 120 GitLab issues with complete evidence blocks
- Metrics validation tooling (scripts/metrics_check.py)
- Citations integrity checks (scripts/citations_linter.py)
- Release artifacts with CSV/MD summaries
- GitLab Pages deployment (public/index.html)
- Continuous validation infrastructure

**Relevance to This Framework:**
The BASE120 validation establishes that all 120 mental models are release-ready with empirical evidence. This provides the foundation for users to select model combinations (Base-N architectures) appropriate for their problem domains.

**Confidence Level:** ✅ HIGH - Direct artifact references, automated validation, peer review complete

---

### 5.2 Base-N Selection Framework (Architectural Design)

**What Base-N Is:**
Base-N (Base6, Base12, Base24, Base36, Base42, BASE120) is a **selection framework** for choosing subsets of validated mental models based on:
- Learning progression (Base6 for beginners → BASE120 for experts)
- Cognitive load management (smaller sets for focused application)
- Domain-specific needs (users select models relevant to their problems)
- Investment optimization (ROI of learning additional models)

**What Base-N Is NOT:**
- ❌ NOT empirically validated for specific problem tiers
- ❌ NOT prescriptive ("you must use Base24 for Tier 3 problems")
- ❌ NOT one-size-fits-all solutions

**Design Philosophy:**
Users and teams decide which mental models from the validated BASE120 set to apply to their specific problems. The Base-N framework provides guidance on subset sizes and learning paths, but **empirical validation of tier-specific coverage is planned future work**.

---

### 5.3 Planned Validation Work (Roadmap)

**Base-N Empirical Testing Study** (Q1-Q2 2026 - Planned)

**Design:**
- Test multiple real-world problems across complexity tiers
- Measure effectiveness of different Base-N model combinations
- Validate tier-to-Base mapping recommendations
- Identify optimal model selections for problem types

**Methodology:**
- Quantitative wickedness scoring (5-question assessment)
- Model application tracking (which models used, frequency, effectiveness)
- Coverage gap analysis (which problem aspects lack model support)
- User feedback and outcome measurement

**Status:** ⏸️ PLANNED
- Framework design: Complete
- Validation protocol: In development
- Execution: Pending resource allocation

**Current Tier Guidance Based On:**
- ✅ Theoretical analysis of model capabilities
- ✅ Framework designers' experience with HUMMBL models
- ✅ Preliminary problem assessments
- ⚠️ NOT yet empirically validated at scale
