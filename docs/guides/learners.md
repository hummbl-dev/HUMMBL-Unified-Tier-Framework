## Your Learning Journey

### Step 1: Identify Your Learning Tier

Review [Learning Progression Tiers](../core/learning-progression.md) and identify where you are:

- **Tier 0 (Awareness):** Building vocabulary, exploring concepts
- **Tier 1 (Beginner):** Learning to apply with guidance
- **Tier 2 (Intermediate):** Integrating multiple models
- **Tier 3 (Advanced):** Designing custom approaches
- **Tier 4 (Master):** Creating new frameworks

### Step 2: Choose Your Base-N Level

Match your learning tier to model count:

- **Tier 0:** Exploring foundational concepts
- **Tier 1:** Base6 (6 models)
- **Tier 2:** Base12-Base24 (12-24 models)
- **Tier 3:** Base24-Base36 (24-36 models)
- **Tier 4:** Base36-BASE120 (36-120 models)

### Step 3: Follow Progressive Path

Don't skip levels - master each before advancing.

---

## Learning Tier 0→1: Building Foundation

**Duration:** 3-6 months

**Goals:**
- Understand framework vocabulary
- Complete first wickedness assessments
- Apply Base6 models with templates
- Build consistent practice

**Activities:**
- Read [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.md)
- Practice [wickedness scoring](../core/wickedness-scoring.md) on simple problems
- Study Base6 models
- Work through guided examples

**Assessment:** Can you score problems independently and apply basic models?

---

## Learning Tier 1→2: Developing Integration

**Duration:** 6-12 months

**Goals:**
- Combine multiple models effectively
- Adapt approaches to context
- Handle moderately complex problems
- Develop personal style

**Activities:**
- Expand to Base12-Base24 models
- Solve real problems independently
- Study case examples
- Teach Tier 0-1 learners

**Assessment:** Can you tackle complex problems without templates?

---

## Learning Tier 2→3: Building Expertise

**Duration:** 1-3 years

**Goals:**
- Design custom frameworks
- Handle wicked problems
- Create organizational approaches
- Contribute to community

**Activities:**
- Master Base24-Base36 models
- Lead complex initiatives
- Document case studies
- Mentor intermediate learners

**Assessment:** Do others seek your expertise for difficult problems?

---

## Learning Tier 3→4: Achieving Mastery

**Duration:** 3+ years

**Goals:**
- Contribute to framework development
- Conduct validation research
- Publish scholarly work
- Train advanced practitioners

**Activities:**
- Study BASE120 complete framework
- Conduct research
- Publish findings
- Build academic/professional partnerships

**Assessment:** Are you advancing the field itself?

---

## Study Strategies

### For Academic Students

**Course Integration:**
- Apply framework to course projects
- Use for research paper topics
- Practice in group assignments
- Teach peers

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. Introduction course (Tier 0→1)
2. Applied course (Tier 1→2)
3. Advanced seminar (Tier 2→3)
4. Independent study (Tier 3→4)

### For Self-Learners

**Self-Directed Path:**
- Set 90-day learning goals
- Practice on real problems
- Join online communities
- Share learnings publicly

**Resources:**
- [Full framework document](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/HUMMBL-Unified-Tier-Framework/blob/main/HUMMBL_Unified_Tier_Framework_v1.0.md)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/HUMMBL-Unified-Tier-Framework/discussions)
- Core documentation pages
