## Overview

This guide provides real-world application strategies for the HUMMBL Framework across different problem types and contexts.

---

## Quick Reference by Tier

### Tier 1: Simple Problems

**Approach:** Apply standard procedures

**Methods:**
- Use checklists and templates
- Follow proven methods
- Focus on execution
- Minimize complexity

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base6

**Examples:** Equipment maintenance, basic scheduling, standard procedures

---

### Tier 2: Complicated Problems

**Approach:** Engage experts, use systematic analysis

**Methods:**
- Break problems into components
- Apply domain expertise
- Use project management
- Follow engineering principles

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base6-Base12

**Examples:** Software development, construction projects, system implementation

---

### Tier 3: Complex Problems

**Approach:** Experiment, adapt, learn

**Methods:**
- Iterative experimentation
- Monitor feedback loops
- Adapt continuously
- Build resilience

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base12-Base24

**Examples:** Organizational change, market strategy, ecosystem management

---

### Tier 4: Wicked Problems

**Approach:** Engage stakeholders, embrace trade-offs

**Methods:**
- Multi-stakeholder dialogue
- Deliberative processes
- Incremental improvements
- Accept inherent trade-offs

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base24-Base36

**Examples:** Education reform, healthcare policy, urban planning

---

### Tier 5: Super-Wicked Problems

**Approach:** Global coordination, long-term commitment

**Methods:**
- Coalition building
- Adaptive governance
- Process innovation
- Long-term commitment

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base36-BASE120

**Examples:** Climate change, pandemic response, global inequality

## Implementation Workflow

**Step 1: Assess** ([Wickedness Scoring Tool](../core/wickedness-scoring.md))
- Score your problem (0-30 points)
- Identify tier classification
- Understand complexity characteristics

**Step 2: Select** ([Base-N Architecture](../core/base-n-architecture.md))
- Choose appropriate model set
- Match to your learning level
- Align with problem demands

**Step 3: Apply**
- Use tier-matched methods
- Engage appropriate stakeholders
- Apply selected mental models

**Step 4: Monitor & Adapt**
- Track outcomes
- Reassess complexity as you learn
- Adjust approach as needed

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Implementing New Process

**Initial Assessment:**
- Stakeholder agreement: Medium → 3 points
- Information: Mostly complete → 2 points
- Solution finality: Needs refinement → 3 points
- Learning: Some adaptation → 3 points
- Time pressure: Moderate → 3 points
- **Total: 14 points = Tier 2**

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use Base12 models
- Systematic project management
- Engage domain experts
- Plan for iteration

---

### Scenario: Cultural Transformation

**Initial Assessment:**
- Stakeholder agreement: Divergent views → 5 points
- Information: Hard to measure → 4 points
- Solution finality: Never truly "done" → 5 points
- Learning: Continuous experimentation → 5 points
- Time pressure: Important, not urgent → 2 points
- **Total: 21 points = Tier 4**

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use Base24-Base36 models
- Deep stakeholder engagement
- Iterative, incremental changes
- Accept ongoing nature
