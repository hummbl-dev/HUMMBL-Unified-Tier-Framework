## For Working Professionals

This guide helps practitioners apply the HUMMBL Framework in professional contexts.

---

## Getting Started

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Assess 3 current work problems using [wickedness scoring](../core/wickedness-scoring.md)
2. Review [problem complexity tiers](../core/problem-complexity-tiers.md)
3. Start with [Base6-Base12 models](../core/base-n-architecture.md)
4. Apply tier-matched approaches
