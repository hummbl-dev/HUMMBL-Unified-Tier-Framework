## Overview

The Learning Progression Framework maps five distinct stages of expertise development, from initial awareness through mastery. This progression guides learners, educators, and organizations in systematically building competence with mental models and problem-solving frameworks.

**Tier Range:** Awareness (Tier 0) → Master (Tier 4)  
**Path:** Pre-Learning → Tool User → Integrator → Architect → Creator  
**Aligned with:** [Base-N Architecture](base-n-architecture.md) for progressive model selection
