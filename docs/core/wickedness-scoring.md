---

## Overview

The **5-Question Wickedness Scoring Tool** provides an objective, quantitative method for assessing problem complexity. This assessment enables appropriate tier classification and guides Base-N model selection.

**Score Range:** 0-30 points  
**Questions:** 5 dimensions of problem complexity  
**Output:** Tier classification (1-5)  
**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes per assessment

## The 5-Question Assessment

### Question 1: Stakeholder Agreement (0-6 points)

**Dimension:** Level of consensus among stakeholders

**Scoring:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | Complete agreement | All stakeholders agree on problem and solution |
| **1-2** | Minor disagreements | Small differences, easily resolved |
| **3-4** | Significant disagreements | Major but reconcilable differences |
| **5-6** | Fundamental disagreements | Irreconcilable worldviews, values conflicts |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Do stakeholders agree on the problem definition?
- Are there shared goals and values?
- Can disagreements be resolved through dialogue?
- Are conflicts fundamental or surface-level?

**Examples:**
- **0 points:** Fixing company printer (everyone agrees it's broken)
- **3 points:** Choosing office location (different preferences, negotiable)
- **6 points:** Abortion policy (fundamental moral disagreements)

---

### Question 2: Information Completeness (0-6 points)

**Dimension:** Availability and clarity of information

**Scoring:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | Complete information | All relevant data available and clear |
| **1-2** | Minor gaps | Some missing info, easily obtainable |
| **3-4** | Significant unknowns | Important information missing or unclear |
| **5-6** | Deep uncertainty | Fundamental unknowns, unknowable factors |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is all relevant information available?
- Can missing information be obtained?
- Are there known unknowns? Unknown unknowns?
- Is the information reliable and actionable?

**Examples:**
- **0 points:** Following a recipe (all steps known)
- **3 points:** Hiring decision (some uncertainty about fit)
- **6 points:** Climate change impacts (deep uncertainty, long timelines)

---

### Question 3: Solution Finality (0-6 points)

**Dimension:** Whether solutions are permanent or evolving

**Scoring:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | Permanent solution | Problem solved completely and permanently |
| **1-2** | Stable solution | Minor adjustments may be needed |
| **3-4** | Evolving solution | Requires ongoing adaptation |
| **5-6** | Never "solved" | Every action creates new problems |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Can this problem be permanently solved?
- Will the solution need ongoing adjustment?
- Does solving create new problems?
- Is there a clear "done" state?

**Examples:**
- **0 points:** Changing a flat tire (permanently fixed)
- **3 points:** Managing employee morale (ongoing effort)
- **6 points:** Urban poverty (solutions create new challenges)

---

### Question 4: Learning Dynamics (0-6 points)

**Dimension:** Role of learning and adaptation in solution

**Scoring:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | No learning needed | Apply known procedures |
| **1-2** | Minimal learning | Some adaptation required |
| **3-4** | Significant learning | Continuous adaptation essential |
| **5-6** | Fundamental learning | Must learn while acting, high stakes |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Can existing knowledge solve this?
- Is experimentation required?
- Do we learn as we attempt solutions?
- Are the stakes too high for trial-and-error?

**Examples:**
- **0 points:** Using a microwave (follow instructions)
- **3 points:** Implementing new software (learn through use)
- **6 points:** Pandemic response (learn while lives at stake)

---

### Question 5: Time Pressure (0-6 points)

**Dimension:** Urgency and temporal constraints

**Scoring:**

| Score | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | No time pressure | Ample time for deliberation |
| **1-2** | Mild pressure | Reasonable deadlines |
| **3-4** | Significant pressure | Tight but manageable timelines |
| **5-6** | Critical urgency | Time running out, catastrophic if delayed |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is there a hard deadline?
- What happens if we delay?
- Can we afford to experiment?
- Is the situation deteriorating?

**Examples:**
- **0 points:** Planning a vacation (flexible timing)
- **3 points:** Quarterly business planning (fixed but reasonable)
- **6 points:** Global climate action (window closing, irreversible harm)

## Scoring & Tier Classification

### Calculate Your Total Score

**Step 1:** Score each question (0-6 points)  
**Step 2:** Add all five scores together  
**Step 3:** Match total to tier range

### Tier Ranges

| Total Score | Tier Classification | Complexity Level |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **0-9** | Tier 1 | Simple |
| **10-14** | Tier 2 | Complicated |
| **15-19** | Tier 3 | Complex |
| **20-24** | Tier 4 | Wicked |
| **25-30** | Tier 5 | Super-Wicked |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Fixing a Bicycle Flat Tire

**Q1: Stakeholder Agreement:** 0 (owner agrees tire needs fixing)  
**Q2: Information Completeness:** 0 (procedure well-known)  
**Q3: Solution Finality:** 0 (tire fixed permanently)  
**Q4: Learning Dynamics:** 0 (apply known procedure)  
**Q5: Time Pressure:** 1 (might want to use bike soon)

**Total:** 1 point → **Tier 1: Simple**

---

### Example 2: Implementing New CRM Software

**Q1: Stakeholder Agreement:** 2 (some resistance to change)  
**Q2: Information Completeness:** 2 (vendor specs available, some unknowns)  
**Q3: Solution Finality:** 3 (will need ongoing configuration)  
**Q4: Learning Dynamics:** 4 (team must learn new system)  
**Q5: Time Pressure:** 3 (business needs driving timeline)

**Total:** 14 points → **Tier 2: Complicated**

---

### Example 3: Organizational Culture Change

**Q1: Stakeholder Agreement:** 4 (different visions of culture)  
**Q2: Information Completeness:** 4 (culture is hard to measure)  
**Q3: Solution Finality:** 5 (ongoing process, never "done")  
**Q4: Learning Dynamics:** 5 (learn through experimentation)  
**Q5: Time Pressure:** 2 (important but not urgent)

**Total:** 20 points → **Tier 4: Wicked**

---

### Example 4: Climate Change Mitigation

**Q1: Stakeholder Agreement:** 6 (fundamental global disagreements)  
**Q2: Information Completeness:** 5 (deep uncertainty about impacts)  
**Q3: Solution Finality:** 6 (every action has unintended consequences)  
**Q4: Learning Dynamics:** 6 (must act despite uncertainty)  
**Q5: Time Pressure:** 6 (window of action closing rapidly)

**Total:** 29 points → **Tier 5: Super-Wicked**

## Common Assessment Challenges

### Challenge 1: Score Clustering

**Issue:** All questions get similar scores

**Solution:**
- Consider each dimension independently
- Look for nuance and variation
- Consult diverse stakeholders
- Review examples for calibration

---

### Challenge 2: Stakeholder Disagreement on Scores

**Issue:** Different raters give different scores

**Solution:**
- Scores reflect rater's perspective (this is valid!)
- Average scores from multiple raters
- Discuss differences to build shared understanding
- Problem tier might differ by stakeholder

---

### Challenge 3: Borderline Scores

**Issue:** Score falls on tier boundary (9-10, 14-15, etc.)

**Solution:**
- Consider both tiers' approaches
- Reassess with additional information
- Start with lower tier, escalate if needed
- Multiple valid interpretations possible

---

### Challenge 4: Changing Tiers Over Time

**Issue:** Problem complexity shifts

**Solution:**
- This is normal and expected!
- Reassess periodically
- Learning can reduce complexity
- New information can increase complexity

---
