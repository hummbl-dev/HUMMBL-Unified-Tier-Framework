# Base-N Architecture

**[Home](../index.md) > Core Framework > Base-N Architecture**

---

## Overview

The Base-N Architecture provides a **systematic framework for selecting mental model combinations** based on learning progression and problem complexity. Rather than overwhelming learners with 120 models simultaneously, Base-N offers progressive learning paths matched to cognitive capacity and problem demands.

**Base Range:** Base6 → BASE120  
**Purpose:** Optimize cognitive load, enable progressive mastery  
**Alignment:** Learning tiers, problem complexity, domain needs

## Problem-Tier Alignment

| Problem Tier | Recommended Base-N | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Tier 1: Simple** | Base6 | Foundational models sufficient |
| **Tier 2: Complicated** | Base6-Base12 | Systematic analysis needed |
| **Tier 3: Complex** | Base12-Base24 | Adaptive frameworks required |
| **Tier 4: Wicked** | Base24-Base36 | Multi-perspective essential |
| **Tier 5: Super-Wicked** | Base36-BASE120 | Maximum theoretical depth |

## Cognitive Load Management

### Why Progressive Levels Matter

**Research Basis:**
- Working memory capacity: 4±1 items (Cowan, 2001)
- Expertise development requires chunking (Chase & Simon, 1973)
- Cognitive overload impairs learning (Sweller, 1988)

**Base-N Strategy:**
1. **Start small** - Master core models deeply
2. **Build chunks** - Combine related models
3. **Expand gradually** - Add complexity progressively
4. **Integrate continuously** - Connect new to existing

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Jumping to BASE120 immediately**
- Cognitive overload
- Surface-level understanding
- No practical application skills

❌ **Staying at Base6 too long**
- Limited problem-solving range
- Missing valuable frameworks
- Stunted growth

✅ **Recommended: Progressive mastery**
- Deep understanding at each level
- Practical application before advancing
- Regular assessment of readiness
