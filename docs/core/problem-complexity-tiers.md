## Overview

The HUMMBL Unified Tier Framework classifies problems into **5 distinct complexity tiers** based on quantitative assessment. This classification enables systematic problem analysis, appropriate method selection, and realistic solution planning.

**Tier Range:** Simple (Tier 1) → Super-Wicked (Tier 5)  
**Scoring System:** 0-30 points across 5 dimensions  
**Assessment Method:** [Wickedness Scoring Tool](wickedness-scoring.md)

## The Five Tiers

### Tier 1: Simple Problems (0-9 points)

**Characteristics:**
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships
- Complete information available
- Well-established solution methods
- Stakeholder agreement on problem definition
- Permanent, stable solutions possible

**Typical Examples:**
- Fixing a flat tire
- Balancing a checkbook
- Following a recipe
- Replacing a light bulb
- Basic mathematical calculations

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Apply standard procedures
- Follow established protocols
- Use documented solutions
- Minimal creativity required

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base6 (6 foundational models)

---

### Tier 2: Complicated Problems (10-14 points)

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple interconnected parts
- Requires specialized expertise
- Clear solution path exists
- Predictable outcomes
- Can be broken into manageable components

**Typical Examples:**
- Sending a rocket to space
- Performing surgery
- Building a bridge
- Developing software from specifications
- Tax preparation for a business

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Engage domain experts
- Apply established methodologies
- Follow engineering principles
- Use systematic analysis

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base6-Base12 (6-12 models)

---

### Tier 3: Complex Problems (15-19 points)

**Characteristics:**
- Emergent properties and behaviors
- Non-linear cause-and-effect
- Requires continuous learning and adaptation
- Multiple valid approaches
- Solutions evolve over time

**Typical Examples:**
- Raising a child
- Organizational culture change
- Ecosystem management
- Traffic flow optimization
- Economic policy development

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Iterative experimentation
- Pattern recognition
- Adaptive management
- Systems thinking
- Continuous feedback loops

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base12-Base24 (12-24 models)

---

### Tier 4: Wicked Problems (20-24 points)

**Characteristics:**
- No definitive problem formulation
- Stakeholders disagree fundamentally
- Every solution creates new problems
- No stopping rule (never "solved")
- Each problem is essentially unique
- Solutions are "better/worse" not "true/false"

**Defining Features (Rittel & Webber, 1973):**
1. No definitive formulation
2. No stopping rule
3. Solutions not true/false but better/worse
4. No immediate test of solution
5. Every solution is a "one-shot operation"
6. No enumerable set of potential solutions
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique
8. Can be symptom of another problem
9. Discrepancies can be explained in numerous ways
10. Planner has no right to be wrong

**Typical Examples:**
- Poverty reduction
- Education reform
- Healthcare system design
- Urban planning
- Criminal justice reform

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Stakeholder engagement
- Multiple perspectives
- Deliberative processes
- Incremental improvements
- Acknowledge trade-offs

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base24-Base36 (24-36 models)

---

### Tier 5: Super-Wicked Problems (25-30 points)

**Characteristics (Levin et al., 2012):**

**All Tier 4 characteristics PLUS:**

1. **Time is running out** - Urgent deadline pressure
2. **Those who cause the problem also seek to solve it** - No central authority
3. **The central authority needed to address them is weak or non-existent**
4. **Policy responses discount the future irrationally**

**Typical Examples:**
- Global climate change
- Pandemic response coordination
- Nuclear proliferation
- Global financial system stability
- Antibiotic resistance

**Problem-Solving Approach:**
- Global coordination
- Long-term commitment
- Adaptive governance
- Multi-stakeholder coalitions
- Innovation in governance structures

**Base-N Recommendation:** Base36-BASE120 (36-120 models)

## Tier Comparison Table

| Dimension | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 | Tier 5 |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Information** | Complete | Complete | Incomplete | Contested | Highly uncertain |
| **Stakeholders** | Agree | Agree | Some disagreement | Fundamental disagreement | Global discord |
| **Solutions** | Permanent | Stable | Evolving | Better/worse | Emergent |
| **Expertise** | Basic | Specialized | Multidisciplinary | Transdisciplinary | Global coordination |
| **Timeline** | Immediate | Defined | Ongoing | Indefinite | Urgent deadline |
| **Authority** | Clear | Clear | Distributed | Weak | Non-existent |

## Assessment Tool

**To determine your problem's tier:**

1. Use the [5-Question Wickedness Scoring Tool](wickedness-scoring.md)
2. Score each question (0-6 points per question)
3. Total your score (0-30 points)
4. Match to tier range

**Score Ranges:**
- 0-9 points = Tier 1 (Simple)
- 10-14 points = Tier 2 (Complicated)
- 15-19 points = Tier 3 (Complex)
- 20-24 points = Tier 4 (Wicked)
- 25-30 points = Tier 5 (Super-Wicked)

---

## Progression & Transitions

**Problems can move between tiers:**
- **Upward:** New information reveals complexity
- **Downward:** Learning reduces uncertainty
- **Dynamic:** Same problem may be different tiers for different stakeholders

**Critical Transitions:**
- **Tier 1→2:** Realizing multiple components exist
- **Tier 2→3:** Discovering emergent behaviors
- **Tier 3→4:** Encountering fundamental disagreements
- **Tier 4→5:** Recognizing time pressure and authority gaps
