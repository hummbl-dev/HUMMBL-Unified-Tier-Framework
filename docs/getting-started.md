## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Assess Your Problem (2 minutes)

Use the [5-Question Wickedness Scoring Tool](core/wickedness-scoring.md):

1. **Stakeholder Agreement** (0-6 points)
2. **Information Completeness** (0-6 points)
3. **Solution Finality** (0-6 points)
4. **Learning Dynamics** (0-6 points)
5. **Time Pressure** (0-6 points)

**Total Score:** ___ / 30

### Step 2: Determine Your Tier (1 minute)

| Score | Tier | Complexity |
|-------|------|------------|
| 0-9 | Tier 1 | Simple |
| 10-14 | Tier 2 | Complicated |
| 15-19 | Tier 3 | Complex |
| 20-24 | Tier 4 | Wicked |
| 25-30 | Tier 5 | Super-Wicked |

### Step 3: Select Your Base-N Level (1 minute)

Match your learning level to model count:

- **New to mental models?** → Start with **Base6**
- **Some experience?** → Use **Base12**
- **Professional practitioner?** → Use **Base24**
- **Advanced leader?** → Use **Base36**
- **Researcher/Expert?** → Use **BASE120**

### Step 4: Apply the Framework (1 minute)

- **For Tier 1-2:** Use standard procedures, follow proven methods
- **For Tier 3:** Experiment, adapt, learn continuously
- **For Tier 4-5:** Engage stakeholders, embrace complexity, iterate

## Your First Assessment

### Example: Planning a Team Retreat

**Q1: Stakeholder Agreement** → 2 (minor preferences differ)  
**Q2: Information Completeness** → 1 (mostly clear requirements)  
**Q3: Solution Finality** → 1 (event happens once, done)  
**Q4: Learning Dynamics** → 2 (some planning adaptation)  
**Q5: Time Pressure** → 2 (reasonable timeline)

**Total: 8 points** → **Tier 1: Simple**

**Recommendation:**
- Use **Base6** foundational models
- Apply standard event planning procedures
- Focus on execution over experimentation

## Next Steps by Role

### For Practitioners

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Assess 3 current problems using the scoring tool
2. Review [Problem Complexity Tiers](core/problem-complexity-tiers.md)
3. Start learning [Base6 mental models](core/base-n-architecture.md#base6-foundational)
4. Read the [Practitioners Guide](guides/practitioners.md)

### For Learners

**Learning Path:**
1. Study [Learning Progression Tiers](core/learning-progression.md)
2. Identify your current learning tier (0-4)
3. Start with appropriate Base-N level
4. Follow the [Learners Guide](guides/learners.md)

### For Researchers

**Research Path:**
1. Review [Validation Evidence](reference/validation-evidence.md)
2. Explore [BASE120 architecture](core/base-n-architecture.md#base120-complete-framework)
3. Consider research collaboration
4. Read the [Researchers Guide](guides/researchers.md)

## Key Concepts to Master

### 1. Problem Complexity ≠ Problem Difficulty

- **Complexity:** Number of interconnected factors, stakeholder agreement
- **Difficulty:** Required expertise, time investment

**Example:** Rocket science is *difficult* but *complicated* (Tier 2), not *wicked* (Tier 4)

### 2. Progressive Mastery Over Breadth

- Master Base6 deeply before expanding to Base12
- Quality over quantity in model selection
- Integration beats accumulation

### 3. Tier Assessment is Perspective-Dependent

- Same problem may be different tiers for different stakeholders
- Your assessment reflects your perspective (this is valid!)
- Multiple valid interpretations exist

### 4. Frameworks Are Tools, Not Rules

- Adapt to context
- Combine approaches
- Use judgment
- Learn from outcomes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Jumping to BASE120 immediately**
- Cognitive overload
- Surface-level understanding
- Poor practical skills

❌ **Using Tier 4 methods for Tier 1 problems**
- Overcomplexity
- Wasted resources
- Delayed action

❌ **Ignoring stakeholder perspectives**
- Missing crucial viewpoints
- Incomplete assessments
- Failed solutions

❌ **Treating scores as absolute truth**
- Scores guide, don't dictate
- Reassess as you learn
- Context always matters

✅ **Instead: Start simple, progress deliberately, adapt continuously**
