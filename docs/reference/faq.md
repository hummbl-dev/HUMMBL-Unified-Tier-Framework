# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### Q: Where should I start?

**A:** Begin with the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.md). Complete your first wickedness assessment in 5 minutes, then explore based on your role:
- **Practitioners:** [Practitioners Guide](../guides/practitioners.md)
- **Learners:** [Learners Guide](../guides/learners.md)
- **Researchers:** [Researchers Guide](../guides/researchers.md)

### Q: Which Base-N level should I use?

**A:** Start with **Base6** if you're new to mental models. Progress to higher levels as you master each stage. See [Base-N Architecture](../core/base-n-architecture.md) for detailed guidance.

### Q: How long does it take to master the framework?

**A:**
- **Base6:** 3-6 months
- **Base12-Base24:** 1-2 years
- **Base36:** 3-5 years
- **BASE120:** 5-10+ years

Progress depends on practice intensity and problem complexity tackled.

## Assessment & Classification

### Q: What if my score falls on a tier boundary?

**A:** This is common! Consider both adjacent tiers' approaches. Start with the lower tier and escalate if needed. Reassess as you learn more.

### Q: Can different people score the same problem differently?

**A:** Yes! This is normal and valuable. Different stakeholders have different perspectives. Average multiple assessments or discuss differences to build shared understanding.

### Q: How often should I reassess problems?

**A:** Reassess when:
- New information emerges
- Stakeholder composition changes
- Solutions reveal unexpected complexity
- Progress suggests tier shift

Typically every 1-3 months for ongoing initiatives.

### Q: Are the 5 questions enough?

**A:** For most problems, yes. The framework balances comprehensiveness with usability. Researchers may develop domain-specific extensions. See [Researchers Guide](../guides/researchers.md).

## Application

### Q: Can I use this for personal decisions?

**A:** Absolutely! The framework scales from personal choices (career, relationships) to global challenges (climate, poverty). Start with [Base6](../core/base-n-architecture.md#base6-foundational).

### Q: Does this work for technical problems?

**A:** Yes. While the framework originated in problem-solving methodology, it applies to technical domains. Many "technical" problems have social/organizational complexity.

### Q: What if I'm already using other frameworks?

**A:** The HUMMBL Framework complements existing methods. Use it to:
- Classify problem complexity
- Select appropriate tools
- Match methodology to tier
- Guide learning progression

### Q: Can teams use this together?

**A:** Yes! Team assessment builds shared understanding. Have each member score independently, then discuss differences. Creates valuable dialogue about problem nature.

## Learning & Progression

### Q: Can I skip directly to BASE120?

**A:** Not recommended. You'll experience cognitive overload and surface-level understanding. Master Base6 deeply, then progress systematically. Quality over quantity.

### Q: How do I know when I'm ready for the next Base-N level?

**A:** You're ready when you:
- Apply current level fluently without templates
- Teach others at your level
- Feel constrained by available models
- Handle problems requiring next tier

### Q: Is there a certification program?

**A:** Not currently. Focus on practical application and outcomes. Consider publishing case studies or contributing to validation research.

## Commercial & Academic Use

### Q: Can I use this in my business?

**A:** Personal/educational use is free. Commercial use (consulting, training, software) requires a license. Contact HUMMBL, LLC via [GitHub](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/HUMMBL-Unified-Tier-Framework) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/hummbl-dev-group/hummbl-dev-project).

### Q: Can I cite this in academic work?

**A:** Yes! Please use proper citation:

## Technical Questions

### Q: What's the difference between complicated and complex?

**A:**
- **Complicated:** Many parts, but predictable. Like a watch - intricate but understandable.
- **Complex:** Emergent behaviors, non-linear. Like an ecosystem - unpredictable interactions.

### Q: What makes a problem "wicked"?

**A:** Rittel & Webber's 10 characteristics:
1. No definitive formulation
2. No stopping rule
3. Solutions better/worse, not true/false
4. No immediate test
5. One-shot operations
6. No enumerable solutions
7. Every problem unique
8. Can be symptom of another
9. Multiple explanations possible
10. No right to be wrong

### Q: What makes a problem "super-wicked"?

**A:** All wicked characteristics PLUS (Levin et al., 2012):
1. Time is running out
2. Causers seek to solve it
3. Weak/no central authority
4. Irrational future discounting

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The framework seems overwhelming. Help?

**A:** Start small:
1. Do ONE wickedness assessment
2. Learn ONE Base6 model
3. Apply to ONE problem
4. Repeat

Don't try to master everything at once.

### Q: I scored my problem but don't know what to do next.

**A:** See tier-specific guidance:
- **Tier 1-2:** [Practical Guide](../guides/practical-guide.md)
- **Tier 3-4:** [Practitioners Guide](../guides/practitioners.md)
- **Any tier:** Start with appropriate [Base-N level](../core/base-n-architecture.md)

### Q: My problem keeps changing tiers.

**A:** This is normal! Problems evolve as you learn. Document tier shifts - they reveal important insights about the problem's true nature.
