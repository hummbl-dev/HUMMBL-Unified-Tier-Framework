## Core Terms

**Base-N Architecture**  
Progressive mental model selection framework (Base6 through BASE120) aligned with learning tiers and problem complexity.

**BASE120**  
Complete mental model framework consisting of 120 models across 6 transformations. Status: Validated October 31, 2025 (9.1/10 quality).

**Complexity**  
Number of interconnected factors, stakeholder perspectives, and emergent behaviors in a problem. Distinct from difficulty.

**Learning Tier**  
Stage of expertise development (Tier 0-4): Awareness, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Master.

**Problem Tier**  
Classification of problem complexity (Tier 1-5): Simple, Complicated, Complex, Wicked, Super-Wicked.

**Wickedness Scoring**  
5-question assessment tool (0-30 points) for quantifying problem complexity across stakeholder agreement, information completeness, solution finality, learning dynamics, and time pressure.

## Problem Types

**Simple Problems (Tier 1)**  
Clear cause-effect, complete information, permanent solutions possible. Score: 0-9 points.

**Complicated Problems (Tier 2)**  
Multiple components, requires expertise, predictable outcomes. Score: 10-14 points.

**Complex Problems (Tier 3)**  
Emergent behaviors, incomplete information, adaptive solutions required. Score: 15-19 points.

**Wicked Problems (Tier 4)**  
No definitive formulation, stakeholder disagreement, solutions create new problems. Score: 20-24 points.

**Super-Wicked Problems (Tier 5)**  
All Tier 4 characteristics PLUS time running out, causers are solvers, weak/no authority, irrational future discounting. Score: 25-30 points.

---

## Learning Stages

**Tier 0: Awareness**  
Pre-learning stage, building vocabulary, exploring concepts.

**Tier 1: Beginner (Tool User)**  
Can apply individual models with guidance, follows procedures, uses templates.

**Tier 2: Intermediate (Integrator)**  
Combines multiple models, adapts to context, developing judgment.

**Tier 3: Advanced (Architect)**  
Designs custom frameworks, creates new combinations, recognizes meta-patterns.

**Tier 4: Master (Creator)**  
Extends framework itself, conducts research, contributes to field advancement.

## Base-N Levels

**Base6**  
6 foundational mental models for beginners and simple problems.

**Base12**  
12 models for emerging practitioners and complicated problems.

**Base24**  
24 models for professional practitioners and complex problems.

**Base36**  
36 models for advanced practitioners and wicked problems.

**Base42**  
42 models for expert/master level practitioners.

**BASE120**  
Complete 120-model framework for researchers and super-wicked problems.

---

## Assessment Terms

**Stakeholder Agreement**  
Degree of consensus among parties affected by or involved in the problem.

**Information Completeness**  
Availability and clarity of relevant data and knowledge.

**Solution Finality**  
Whether solutions are permanent, stable, or require ongoing adaptation.

**Learning Dynamics**  
Role of experimentation and adaptation in finding solutions.

**Time Pressure**  
Urgency and temporal constraints affecting problem-solving.

---

## Framework Components

**5-Question Assessment**  
Wickedness scoring tool evaluating problems across 5 dimensions, 0-6 points each.

**6 Transformations**  
BASE120 organization: Cognitive, Systems, Strategic, Social, Evolutionary, Meta models.

**Tier Classification**  
Process of mapping wickedness scores to problem complexity levels.

---

## Related Concepts

**Cognitive Load**  
Mental effort required to process information. Base-N manages load through progressive complexity.

**Emergence**  
Patterns or behaviors arising from system interactions, not predictable from components alone.

**Mental Model**  
Framework for understanding and reasoning about a domain or problem.

**Systems Thinking**  
Approach focusing on interconnections, feedback loops, and holistic understanding.
