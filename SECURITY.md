## Security Considerations

### Nature of This Project

The HUMMBL Unified Tier Framework is a **documentation and methodology project**. It consists of:

- Markdown documentation files
- Conceptual frameworks and methodologies
- Assessment protocols and guidelines
- No executable code or software applications
- No data collection or processing systems
- No user authentication or authorization systems

### Potential Security Concerns

While this is primarily a documentation project, potential security concerns include:

1. **Intellectual Property Protection**
   - Unauthorized use of proprietary components
   - Misattribution or plagiarism
   - License violations

2. **Documentation Integrity**
   - Malicious modifications to framework content
   - Injection of misleading information
   - Tampering with attribution or citations

3. **Repository Security**
   - Unauthorized access to repository
   - Malicious pull requests or commits
   - Social engineering attacks on maintainers

4. **Link Security**
   - Malicious links injected into documentation
   - Phishing attempts via external links
   - Compromised external resources

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### For All Contributors

1. **Verify Links:**
   - Check all external links before adding
   - Use HTTPS where available
   - Avoid linking to suspicious or unverified sources

2. **Protect Credentials:**
   - Never commit API keys, passwords, or tokens
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Review commits before pushing

3. **Review Pull Requests:**
   - Carefully review changes from unknown contributors
   - Check for suspicious links or content
   - Verify attribution and citations

4. **Maintain Attribution:**
   - Preserve intellectual property notices
   - Maintain proper citations
   - Follow license requirements

### For Maintainers

1. **Access Control:**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Limit repository access to trusted individuals
   - Regularly review access permissions

2. **Code Review:**
   - Review all pull requests carefully
   - Check for malicious content or links
   - Verify contributor identity for sensitive changes
   - Use signed commits where possible

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Keep tooling and dependencies updated
   - Monitor for security advisories
   - Use automated security scanning (Dependabot, etc.)

4. **Incident Response:**
   - Have a plan for security incidents
   - Document and communicate issues promptly
   - Coordinate disclosure with reporters
   - Learn from incidents and improve processes

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. External Links

**Risk:** External links in documentation could become compromised or malicious over time.

**Mitigation:**
- Regular link validation (automated checks)
- Prefer links to reputable, stable sources
- Use archived versions for critical references
- Monitor for link rot or suspicious redirects

### 2. Intellectual Property

**Risk:** Proprietary components could be misused or misattributed.

**Mitigation:**
- Clear license terms (LICENSE.md)
- Explicit attribution requirements
- Regular monitoring for unauthorized use
- Legal recourse for violations

### 3. Repository Access

**Risk:** Unauthorized access could lead to malicious modifications.

**Mitigation:**
- Protected main branch (requires reviews)
- Two-factor authentication required
- Limited write access
- Audit logs reviewed regularly

### 4. Social Engineering

**Risk:** Attackers could impersonate maintainers or contributors.

**Mitigation:**
- Verify identity for sensitive communications
- Use official channels only
- Be skeptical of urgent requests
- Confirm major changes through multiple channels
